    "## General Goal\n",
    "We want to find the best parameters $\\theta$ to some function $$F_\\theta(h_0) = h_L,$$ such that we can map our input data $$h_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{b\\times n_{0,1}\\times\\dots \\times n_{0,d} \\times c_0}$$ to our target data $$h_L \\in \\mathbb{R}^{b \\times n_{L,1}\\times \\dots \\times n_{L,d} \\times c_L}.$$ Since usually the whole data can't be fed into the network at once, and there are actually advantages of not doing so, we choose *minibatches* of $b$ samples to feed into the network at once. Depending on the data, we need different additional dimensions, ranging from just one-dimensional data ($h_0 \\in \\mathbb{R}^{b \\times c_L}$) to multiple dimensions as for instance for images. The last dimension $c$ denotes the *feature map* or *channel*. Each of the $b$ samples we process at once has $c_l$ feature maps for each layer $l$, with dimensions $n_{l,1}\\times \\dots \\times n_{l,d}$. \n",
    "## General Structure\n",
    "A network is a combination of various small components, whose properties are well understood. Any differentiable function can theoretically be used as a component of a network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Classical networks can be roughly split into individual *layers*. Such layers usually follow a similar structure, which we will quickly go through in the next paragraph:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a network of $L$ layers. The first component of each layer $l$ is a mapping function $\\Psi_l(h_{l-1},\\theta_l)$, which linearly combines the inputs, here the outputs of layer $l-1$:\n",
    "$$z_l = \\Psi_l(h_{l-1},\\theta_{l}).$$\n",
    "The weights $\\theta_l$ of these linear combinations are parameters of the network, that we are going to *train*. Now, the so-called *activation function* $\\Phi$ (also *nonlinearity* or *squashing function*) is applied:\n",
    "$$a_l = \\Phi_l(z_l,\\theta_{l}).$$\n",
    "Without this function, all our linear combinations could be reduced to one linear combination, which would greatly reduce the different functions we can approximate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification networks, we can also use downsampling operations $\\Gamma_l$, which could be pooling operations, convolutions with a stride larger than 1, or if not present, just the identity transform:\n",
    "$$h_l = \\Gamma_l(a_l,\\theta_l).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, one full layer can then be described as the application of the combined function $\\Lambda_l$ to the previous layer's output $h_{l-1}$, using weights $\\theta_l$:\n",
    "$$h_l = \\Lambda_l(h_{l-1},\\theta_l) = \\Gamma_l(\\Phi_l(\\Psi_l(h_{l-1},\\theta_l),\\theta_l),\\theta_l).$$\n",
    "The first layer just takes the input data instead of the previous layer's output.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the last layer, we finally add a *cost function* (also *loss* or *objective function*), which lets us define what we want the network to learn. Given we are applying supervised learning and are provided with labels  $y$, we can define a loss $\\mathcal{L}(h_L)$. We now want to find the weights $\\theta$ that minimize this loss:\n",
    "$$\\DeclareMathOperator*{\\argmin}{arg\\,min}\n",
    "\\argmin_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(h_L, y).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the concept of layers is differently defined and is only partly useful when defining the graph structure of a network, we will continue our explanations with respect to the individual components making up layers. The stacking of those to one classical layer is then a straight-forward task. In the following, we will use **component**, **layer**, and **node** interchangeably for one atomic element of our network graph!"
